<h3>Establishment of the Saudi Arabia  </h3>


  <p><img src="images/demo_img.jpg" alt="Kiwi" width="159" height="140" class="float_right" />  Saudi Arabia's history spans over for nearly three centuries, and it appeared in three stages. First Saudi state began with the Alliance between Imam Mohammed Bin Saud and Imam Mohammed Bin Abdul Wahhab in 1157 A.H. (1744). The historical sources fully document the account of the establishment of the First Saudi state, the Second Saudi State, and the Third Saudi State when King Abdulaziz Bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud - may Allah's mercy be upon him - re-gained the control of Riyadh after a decisive battle in 1902 AD. Even today, historians acknowledge the brave and well-organized battle that accomplished this. King Abdulaziz and his countrymen then continued the journey toward unification of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, bringing in all the present day provinces into a unified one state, for the first time in the history of the Arabian Peninsula.  </p>
  
  
  
  
 


<h3>King Abdulaziz Bin Abdul Rahman Bin Faisal Al-Saud - May his soul rest in peace (1902-1953)</h3>
  
  
  <p> King Saud founded the Kingdom when he reclaimed Riyadh in 1319 A.H./1902, after which he unified the state and spread security, stability, and justice. He also established foundations, issued regulations, launched the process of development and modernization and served the Two Holy Mosques as well as Arab and Islamic issues. King Abdulaziz is the founder of modern Saudi Arabia, and he led and participated in all the major events leading to the unification of the country. He orchestrated both the internal and external policies of Saudi Arabia concerning the growth, development and prosperity for its citizens. He also maintained the country's unity and entity as the heart of the "Muslim world" and the leading proponent of Arabs and Muslims.</p>
